    Job Searcher is an app for finding job listings from multiple sites at once. <br>
    It is built using Material Components for the Web and jQuery. <br>
    It depends on API's provided by Jooble, Reed.co.uk, and Adzuna. <br>
    To use the app, navigate to the Search page and enter a job title. <br>
